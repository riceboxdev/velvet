# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through adding a waitlist to your iOS app.

## Prerequisites

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.9+

## Step 1: Create a Waitlist

1. Sign up at [velvet.app](https://velvet.app)
2. Create a new waitlist from the dashboard
3. Copy your **API Key** and **Waitlist ID**

## Step 2: Add the SDK

Add the Velvet SDK via Swift Package Manager:

1. In Xcode, go to **File → Add Package Dependencies...**
2. Enter the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/riceboxdev/Velvet
   ```
3. Select the `Waitlist` package
4. Click **Add Package**

## Step 3: Configure and Use

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Waitlist

struct ContentView: View {
    let config = WaitlistConfig(
        apiKey: "your-api-key",
        waitlistId: "your-waitlist-id"
    )
    
    var body: some View {
        WaitlistView(config: config)
    }
}
```

That's it! Your app now has a fully functional waitlist signup form.
