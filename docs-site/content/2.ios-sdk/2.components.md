# Components

The SDK provides three pre-built SwiftUI components for different use cases.

## WaitlistView

A full-screen waitlist signup experience:

```swift
WaitlistView(config: config)
```

### Customization

```swift
WaitlistView(
    config: config,
    title: "Get Early Access",
    subtitle: "Join the waitlist to be first in line.",
    buttonText: "Request Invite",
    successMessage: "You're in! We'll email you when it's your turn."
)
```

### Handle Acceptance

```swift
WaitlistView(
    config: config,
    onAccepted: {
        // User was accepted off the waitlist
        navigateToMainApp()
    }
)
```

---

## WaitlistButton

A button that opens the waitlist in a sheet:

```swift
WaitlistButton(config: config, label: "Join Waitlist")
```

### Button Styles

```swift
// Primary (default)
WaitlistButton(config: config, label: "Join", style: .primary)

// Secondary
WaitlistButton(config: config, label: "Join", style: .secondary)

// Custom colors
WaitlistButton(
    config: config,
    label: "Join",
    style: .custom(foreground: .white, background: .purple)
)
```

## WaitlistBanner

An inline signup form for embedding in scrollable content:

```swift
ScrollView {
    VStack {
        Text("My App Content")
        
        WaitlistBanner(
            config: config,
            title: "Join the Waitlist",
            subtitle: "Be the first to know when we launch"
        )
    }
}
```
